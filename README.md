# Microsoft Codility Interview Question

This project describes the solution to a codility programming challenge for position of developer at Microsoft 

## Description

Given a String representation of a Binary Number N where the length of N is in the range 1-1000000000 ,two actions can be performed on N ,if its odd subtract 1 ,if even divide it by 2. Iterate this operation until N is 0. 


Write an "Efficient" function:

class Solution { public int solution(String N); }

that, given a positive integer N, returns the number of operations it requires to get N to 1. 

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer whose binary representation is of length within the range [1..10000000].
